# Phouse
Phone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) powered mouse cursor. 

Essentially, I kept forgetting my mouse for robotics practices, which made it extremely hard for me to utilize computer-aided-design software such as Autodesk Inventor or SolidWorks (with trackpad).

So, I made this project, since I never forget my phone!
